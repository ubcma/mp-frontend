## **About UBCMA**
UBCMA is UBC's only marketing-focused club, offering students opportunities to connect, learn, and grow in the field of marketing. Traditionally, the club relied on third-party platforms like Showpass for event management, which had limited features. The UBCMA Membership Portal was developed to replace this process, reducing costs, streamlining workflows, and fostering a stronger community.
